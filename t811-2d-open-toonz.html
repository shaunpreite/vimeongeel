                            <p> Looks like we will have another free alternative to Spriter and Spline soon. > Digital Video, the makers of TOONZ, and DWANGO, a Japanese publisher, announced today they have signed an agreement for the acquisition by Dwango of Toonz, an animation software which was independently developed by Digital Video (Rome, Italy). > > Digital Video and Dwango agreed to close the deal under the condition Dwango will publish and develop an Open Source platform based on Toonz (OpenToonz). Sorry for the butchered title I jus wanted to give a good deal of what I'm using. I got the open sourced Toonz software, I have very little experience with animation I've done a couple ball bounces around a room before, but I want to start trying a bit more, but I don't know where to start? I am very inexperienced, I have little understanding of what to use a key frame for, when I know to use one, and what to make. What are some good things to start off with? Simple things Hey, I want to build a Pc for 2d/3d Animation (Blender, Open Toonz), Video-stuff (DaVinci Resolve), other grahic stuff (Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo) as well as a bit of gaming (not the main Focus) and Audio recording(as well, not the Focus). Since I am a Student my Budget is pretty limeted (around 1000 €) and I still Need an operating System (preferably Windows 10) and a Monitor (since I am switching from my iMac I dont have one I could use). I have a good mouse and decent Keyboard. Does anyone have any experience with the free 2D software OpenToonz? I'm currently learning animate but have read good stuff about OpenToonz and was wondering if it would be worth it to divert 
~~Okk. so basically I'm monkey~~ But seriously, is there any FREE animation software I can download which will allow me to create quality animation in? For example, I want to be able to draw in it, nothing too special, but a software with a color wheel, layers, etc. some of what you can find in a regular drawing program. I've seen some other software like Pencil 2D, however I don't know if it'll let me draw to my "full" capabilities. I'm asking because. All software listed here is free  This turned out to be a community project of recommended software. Before installing software - i recommend scanning it for viruses here: https://www.virustotal.com You can check for program alternatives here: https://alternativeto.net Check my guide about simple and automated windows 10 gaming pc setup : https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/7xwvco/simple_windows_10_gaming_pc_setup_from_scratch/ Check my guide about windows memory. I'm inspired by animation both 2D and 3D and want to learn and do it. I've already started learning Blender and probably will go with OpenToonz or Anime Studio into the New Year. Anyways I was watching Some episodes by Extra Credits and noticed on my watchlist a few other commentators that do similar framing to make their "animations". Now I think these kinds of videos are good especially if I want to make a weekly VLOG. Yes re-using a lot of (my) frames. But I was wondering if the community. TLDR: What is your recommended training or portfolio work to get started in your job/department for the games industry? I've started self training to do more art, 3D modeling, essentially prepare to start doing freelance work and content creation. Want to work in the game industry at some point but know I have competition. Starting at 30 years old with almost zero experience (changing careers). Which is why I have to start up my own stuff. I'm looking for ideas for things I can self train 
Total budget and country of purchase: No more than 0, USA Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. Good battery life and best specs for the money. Don't care about 2 in 1. How important is weight and thinness to you? Weight isn't overly important to me. I'm willing to sacrifice weight if need be, but I will be carrying this on my back a lot (I'm a University student), so if possible Hello, I've been a user of Blender for a while now and I've really been enjoying Grease Pencil, but I've found the timeline inadequate for my use as an animator. I've had an idea, or less a wish, to get a 2D timeline in Blender. One I like a lot is the timeline in a program called OpenToonz (a free and open source Adobe Animate and Toonboom Alternative). The only issue is, I'm not a programmer and I know nothing about programming and I know that it's not an easy task. I was just wondering. So basically, I want something, that  allows for easy import of assembled characters (.psd files?), like Moho Studio or AnimeEffects ( has bone parenting allows for "sandwiched" layer compositions e.g: Alice standing behind Bob is covering Bob's mouth, so her arm needs to be in front of Bob's layers but of course her arm should still be parented to her shoulder (behind Bob), s.t. it moves when she does and Bob should be able to "step. Checking the Software Manager for 2D Animation progs, and I have 3 choices: Synfigstudio, Tupi and OpenToonz. If anyone here has any experience with one or more, I'd sure love to hear your thoughts and/or a recommendation as to which one is your favorite. Thanks. So 2 years ago u/ch3w0nth1s posted this thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/2ygshk/what_animation_programs_do_you_use_what_are_the) and I thought we should revisit it. In the comments please list what you use, what the pros and cons are, and if possible please include a link of some work created in that program. - # 2D and 3D - After Effects - Website ( Pros - Deep and powerful.

Hi, I just got a Wacom Medium Pro, and for a school thingy I'm going to try and make animations, so I'm looking for a free 2d animation software that is easy to learn. So far I've tried Tupi 2D Magic and OpenToonz, but I ran into issues with them. So please any suggestions would be very much appreciated. Hello I am a British student at Yale for 4 years, currently doing an animation module. I am creating a 480 frame film at 24fps and there is a story board to follow. I was hoping I might be struck with some luck on here. The assets I need are hand drawings of all the characters/assets divided into 2D parts I can create a skeleton for in the animation package so that I can make them move more realistically. The assets need to be in 2D not 3D. If it helps somewhat, the package I'm using is OpenToon. Yo guys, how is your day? Take a moment of R&R and chat away. For fellow animator or maybe hobbyist OpenToonz, the 2D Animation Software Used by Studio Ghibli, Is Now Free (http://lifehacker.com/opentoonz-the-2d-animation-software-used-by-studio-ghi-1767833445).

Video Editing HitFilm 4 Express (https://hitfilm.com/express) – For mac and PC. Highly recommended! Modern user interface and technology. Includes a video editor and compositor all in one (like Adobe Premier and After. Hi, I'm thinking about making a video mixing real live video with 2D animation. Is it possible in OpenToonz to add a video as a background and then draw, e.g., frame by frame the animation on top of the video? I know it's somehow possible with SynFig by exporting the video into single images. I'm not a 2D animator. I'm doing a lip sync exercise for college. It's less than 10 seconds. It has to be 2D, so I'm trying OpenToonz. I have some questions: Is there a way to use the same drawing on 2 frames and then make one of those "unique" so I can change it without changing the other? How can I arrange the columns in the x-sheet? How can I change the thickness of a segment of a line? Is there a long boring manual I can read? Thanks in advance. I am a Web Developer and student Illustrator/Animator. As an animator, I have experimented with many 2D animation programs in order to perfect the craft. Things like Pivot Stick Figure Animator, Adobe Flash/Animate, Toon Boom, Pencil 2D, SM Anime Studio, Photoshop's Timeline, RETAS Studio, etc. While all of these programs have their own strengths, I conclude that OpenToonz is the best for me, personally. Now, in order to improve the way I will use OpenToonz now and in the future 
I know that right now with regards to 2D animation, Adobe Animate CC is pretty much the industry standard. But I just got OpenToonz today and, though complicated, it's something I am really interested in and want to learn. I guess what I'm saying is, do you think OpenToonz will become popular with animation production companies in the future and possible overtake flash animation? Or is Adobe Animate CC still the way of the future. Hi, I recently started playing around with OpenToonz. I must admit I am very new to both this program and animation in general, but I'm trying to learn. I'm having trouble with rendering. I made a simple 2d animation of a stick figure waving hello and want to export it to .avi. I've chosen avi at output settings. When I render though, it comes out as all black (when I play the avi with VLC). In the preview it looks fine, the background is white and the stick figure is black.
